CakePHP Enhancements
=============

This is a collection of CakePHP helpers, components and plugins that I've created through the years of developing applications on the framework.
Whilst there are thousands of freely available code snippets out there, the occasional use case hasn't been covered or done slightly differently to how I need it.
In these instances, I've made the code available for others to (ab)use.
